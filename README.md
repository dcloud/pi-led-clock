# pi-led-clock

Python-powered clock for the [ Unicorn Hat HD ](http://docs.pimoroni.com/unicornhathd/).

I've got a Unicorn Hat HD and a Raspberry Pi Zero, why not make it into a tiny LED clock?

## Notes

At rotation 0, the unicornhathd's origin is on the left side of the edge with the header.

unicornhathd at 90 degrees is:
- x left to right
- y top to bottom
